    "# Pipe Center Finder\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PipeCenterFinder` determines the center position and cross-sectional geometry of a cylindrical pipe from laser-cross wall intersection points observed at different z-positions (stage positions along the pipe axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In volumetric PIV camera calibration, the camera needs to be calibrated to a coordinate system inside the pipe. This requires knowing the physical pipe center -- but without a calibrated camera, we cannot directly measure positions in world coordinates. The `PipeCenterFinder` breaks this chicken-and-egg problem through a bootstrapping approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Move the laser stage to several z-positions and image the wall intersections.\n",
    "2. Fit the pipe center $z_0$ from chord lengths -- this is already in **stage coordinates (mm)**, no camera calibration needed.\n",
    "3. Move the stage to $z_0$, then use the fitted **(u, v) center** in image space to drive the x/y stage axes until the laser intersection sits at the desired image position.\n",
    "4. Read the physical x/y positions from the stage encoders -- the pipe center is now known in world coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera calibration is the *output* of the overall process, not an input. Each axis stays in its native coordinate space (z in mm from the stage, u/v in pixels from the camera), so no cross-domain calibration is required at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "A laser cross projected into a pipe produces two lines that intersect the inner pipe wall. By imaging these intersections at several z-positions, the chord length varies parabolically with z -- longest at the pipe center, shrinking towards the edges. Fitting this parabola yields the pipe center and elliptical cross-section parameters, with full uncertainty propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/pipe-wall-intersections.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image above shows four camera frames at different z-positions. The red markers indicate detected wall intersection points -- these are the input to the `PipeCenterFinder`."
