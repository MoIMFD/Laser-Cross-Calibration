    "# Introduction to Laser Cross Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to the `laser_cross_calibration` framework. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What laser cross calibration is and why it is useful\n",
    "- The core concepts of the framework (optical systems, interfaces, sources, and tracers)\n",
    "- How to set up a simple optical system\n",
    "- How to trace laser beams through optical media\n",
    "- How to validate your simulations against real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Laser Cross Calibration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Laser cross calibration is a measurement technique where two laser beams intersect to determine the 3D position of their crossing point. By moving a stage with two fixed laser sources and tracking how the intersection point moves, we can calibrate the relationship between stage movement and the measured position.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is particularly useful in:\n",
    "- 3D metrology and positioning systems\n",
    "- Optical alignment tasks\n",
    "- Understanding how light propagates through different media\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `laser_cross_calibration` framework simulates how laser beams propagate through optical systems with different materials and geometries. It uses ray tracing to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Track rays through multiple optical interfaces (e.g., air-glass, glass-water boundaries)\n",
    "2. Apply physics-based refraction at each interface using Snell's law\n",
    "3. Find where multiple rays intersect in 3D space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work through a real-world example based on research by Gunady et al., who used a 3D printer stage and two laser pointers for calibration. This example demonstrates all key concepts of the framework."

    "### Setup\n",
    "Gunady et al. used a 3D printer xyz-stage and two laser pointer for laser cross calibration. We can use their setup as an example and to validate the simulation pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Logic\n",
    "The simulation logic works as follows:\n",
    "1. Create a container for all surface components which can interact with the beams. \n",
    "    - The corresponding object is `OpticalSystem`\n",
    "    - Create surface geometries which define the locations of optical interfaces in space\n",
    "    - Define optical interfaces from a geometrie and two materials (pre and post surface)\n",
    "    - Add the interface to the optical system\n",
    "2. Define a laser beam source\n",
    "    - In this case we use a `DualLaserStageSource` defining two laser beam sources with fixed geometrical relations\n",
    "3. Create a tracer (`RayTracer`)\n",
    "    - The tracer takes the system and a list of source to trace the rays emitted by the sources through the optical system.\n",
    "4. Optionally the scene can be visualized using a `Scene` object.\n",
    "    - Add all components to visualize and use the `make_figure` method to create a `plotly` graph\n",

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building the optical system, let's understand the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. OpticalSystem\n",
    "The `OpticalSystem` is a container that holds all optical interfaces (surfaces) that interact with light rays. Think of it as your virtual optical bench where you place all components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key parameter:**\n",
    "- `final_propagation_distance`: After passing through all interfaces, rays continue propagating this distance in the final medium. This ensures rays travel far enough to find intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optical Interfaces\n",
    "An `OpticalInterface` represents a boundary between two materials where refraction occurs (e.g., an air-glass surface). Each interface consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometry**: The shape and position of the surface (e.g., plane, sphere)\n",
    "- **material_pre**: The material BEFORE the surface (where the ray comes from)\n",
    "- **material_post**: The material AFTER the surface (where the ray goes to)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Surface Normals\n",
    "Each surface has a **normal vector** that points OUTWARD from the material:\n",
    "- The normal defines which side is \"inside\" vs \"outside\" the material\n",
    "- When a ray hits the surface, the framework uses the normal to determine the angle of incidence\n",
    "- **Critical**: Always ensure normals point outward from solid materials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Materials\n",
    "The framework includes predefined materials with their refractive indices:\n",
    "- `lcc.materials.AIR`: Refractive index ~1.0\n",
    "- `lcc.materials.WATER`: Refractive index ~1.33\n",
    "- `lcc.materials.GLASS_FUSED_SILICA`: Refractive index ~1.46\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Sources\n",
    "Sources define where laser beams originate and their direction. The `DualLaserStageSource` simulates a stage with two laser pointers at fixed positions and angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. RayTracer\n",
    "The `RayTracer` performs the actual simulation:\n",
    "- Takes rays from sources\n",
    "- Propagates them through the optical system\n",
    "- Applies refraction at each interface\n",
    "- Finds where rays intersect"
